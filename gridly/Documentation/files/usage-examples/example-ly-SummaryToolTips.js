With \\gridInit you define the dimensions of the grid: how many segments it should have and which parts it contains. In this case we are initializing a grid with four segments and three parts, namely &quot;marks&quot;, &quot;soprano&quot; and &quot;basso&quot;.</div></div>",35:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TInformation Llilypond\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">Now we can start to enter the music! The interface of \\gridPutMusic is the same of \\gridSetSegmentTemplate, with the additional parameter `part` that specifies the part you are working on.</div></div>",36:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TInformation Llilypond\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">As for missing cells, if there is structure defined for them (as in this example), then they will be replaced in the output by dummy cells, filled with skips. If the structure is not defined, then you will get an error.</div></div>",37:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TInformation Llilypond\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">It is possible to compile a single cell to a separate mini-score.&nbsp; This is a useful tool when working on large scores because it reduces the time needed to wait for recompilation to the very small amount that is necessary for the currently edited grid cell.</div></div>",38:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TInformation Llilypond\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">With the following command you can print the current grid state, with `o` symbols marking entered segments and `-` symbols denoting missing segments.</div></div>",39:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TInformation Llilypond\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">The following command checks that, for each segment, each part of that segment has the same duration as the one specified in the structure for that segment. If not, it issues a warning on the console. If there is no structure specified for that segment (remember, structure specification is optional), then the function checks that all the parts have the same duration for that segment.&nbsp; This check is completely optional, but it may produce more meaningful warnings than the errors that LilyPond itself will give you when there is something wrong with the grid contents.</div></div>",40:"<div class=\"NDToolTip TInformation Llilypond\"><div class=\"TTSummary\">Limiting output</div></div>"});
